#  Project Overview

This project implements a **graph-based navigation system** using an adjacency list. The system allows users to:

- Add, update, and delete cities, represented as nodes in a graph
- Add and remove edges between cities, with each edge having an associated distance
- Perform graph traversal using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithms
- Calculate the **shortest path** between two cities using **Dijkstra's algorithm**
- Maintain **data persistence** through file storage
